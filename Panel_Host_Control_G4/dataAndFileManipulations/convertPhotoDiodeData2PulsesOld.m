% function convData = convertPhotoDiodeData2Pulses(pdData)
%
% This function takes the photodiode data and converts it into 0s and 1s
% using certain assumptions. Ths function is necessary since erading from
% LEDs are actually short pulses (within the ON pulse) and not constant values
% Assmes 100KHz sampling rate
%
% INPUT
% pdData -      1XN vector of photodiode values
%
% convData -    1XN vector of 0 (OFF) and 1 (ON) values

% Parameters for conversion

sampBetweenLEDPeaks = 20; % number of samples between PD peaks within an ON pulse
numberOfInt = 6; %number of intervals without signal to still consider consequetive
