% function posTrace = findPositionFromVoltage(voltageTrace, actualPosFunc, freq)

% This function takes the recorded position trace and assigns position values for each index
%
% INPUT
% voltageTrace -    (1XN vector) recorded output from panelcontroller
% protocol
% freq =            2 element vector. First is the sampling freqency and second is
%                   display freqeuncy (freq with which position function
%                   was read). 
% numPos -          Max number of position in the pattern (Could be higher than actual number used). 
%
% OUTPUT
% posTrace -        vector the same length as voltageTrace, with positions
%                   instead of voltage values
