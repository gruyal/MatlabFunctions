function fixedIm = fixImAfterRot(stimIm, relVal, direction)

% This function is to be used after the minimal motion stimulus is rotated
% 45 degrees. It finds the cases where individual rows still exists and
% corrects the rest of the image with that.

% INPUT 
% stimIm -      image that was rotated 45 degrees and is distorted (before
%               mask is applied)
% relVal -      value to correct
% direction -   1 or -1 to indicate direction of diagonal

imSiz = size(stimIm); 
midI = ceil(imSiz(1)/2);

   tempDiff = find(diff(indsDiff) == 0);  % proper values of skipped pixels between lines
   skipSize = indsDiff(tempDiff(1)+1);
